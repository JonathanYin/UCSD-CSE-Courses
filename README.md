# UCSD CSE Courses

## My Personal Notes and Thoughts on every UCSD CSE Course I've taken

### CSE 12 - Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design

- **Greg Miranda, Winter 2021**

### CSE 15L - Software Tools and Techniques Laboratory

### CSE 30 - Computer Organization and Systems Programming

### CSE 100 - Advanced Data Structures

### CSE 105 - Theory of Computability

- **Shachar Lovett, Winter 2022**

### CSE 101 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

### CSE 110 - Software Engineering

- **Thomas Powell, Fall 2022**
- The entire class is essentially a quarter-long project with a team of around 10 students, with the goal being to make a full-stack web application using HTML, CSS and JS
- Labs are assigned every week to teach concepts in HTML, CSS, JS, Jest/Puppeteer, and more
- *My Thoughts:* I fairly enjoyed the class, as someone with a fair amount of experience with both front-end and back-end web development. That being said, the class itself doesn't go into database systems whatsoever, and every group is supposed to use local storage/Vanilla JS for their site. The course does provide some insights into agile development and CI/CD which I thought were pretty helpful, but most of the actual learning is done through MDN Web Docs and Googling. 

### CSE 140 - Components and Design Techniques for Digital Systems

- **John Eldon, Fall 2022**

### CSE 140L - Digital Systems Laboratory

- **John Eldon, Fall 2022**
