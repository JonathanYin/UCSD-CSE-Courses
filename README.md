# UCSD CSE Courses

## My Personal Notes and Thoughts on every UCSD CSE Course I've taken

Feel free to reach out with any questions/comments. Additional notes will be uploaded as I continue my time at UCSD.

### CSE 11 - Introduction to Programming and Computational Problem-Solving: Accelerated Pace

- **Greg Miranda, Fall 2020**

### CSE 12 - Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design

- **Greg Miranda, Winter 2021**

### CSE 15L - Software Tools and Techniques Laboratory

- **Keith Muller, Winter 2021**

### CSE 30 - Computer Organization and Systems Programming

- **Keith Muller, Fall 2021**

### CSE 100 - Advanced Data Structures

- **Niema Moshiri, Winter 2022**

### CSE 105 - Theory of Computability

- **Shachar Lovett, Winter 2022**

### CSE 101 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

- **Russell Impagliazzo, Spring 2022**

### CSE 110 - Software Engineering

- **Thomas Powell, Fall 2022**
- The entire class is essentially a quarter-long project with a team of ~10 students, with the goal being to make a full-stack web application using HTML, CSS and JS
- Labs are assigned every week to teach concepts in HTML, CSS, JS, Jest/Puppeteer, and more
- There are two midterms, both of which are closed-note paper exams, which test you on your understanding of software engineering concepts, basic web design ideas, and other terminology.
- *My Thoughts:* I fairly enjoyed the content covered, as someone with a fair amount of experience with both front-end and back-end web development. That being said, the course doesn't go into database systems whatsoever, and every group is supposed to use local storage/Vanilla JS for their site, which is extremely unrealistic for any real-world web application. The course does, however, provide some insights into agile development and CI/CD which I thought were pretty helpful, but most of the actual learning is done through MDN Web Docs and Googling. Good introduction to modern web development and some of the broader concepts behind software engineering.

### CSE 140 - Components and Design Techniques for Digital Systems

- **John Eldon, Fall 2022**

### CSE 140L - Digital Systems Laboratory

- **John Eldon, Fall 2022**
